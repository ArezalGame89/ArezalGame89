# The main deed
Name's Arezalgamer89, but I go with too many nicknames.

My hobbies and favorites change over time and programming with github is one of them.

Some hobbies include:
- gaming
- programming
- computer IT
- linux hardcore
- animationing
- developing games
- writing SRA documents
- procrastinating

Most of the things you see here is written in Python and usually uploaded to @Special-Rocket-Agents [\(SRA)](https://github.com/Special-Rocket-Agents) so I can test out Organizations.

[I also hold out a site which I write my incoherent thoughts in there](https://arezg.neocities.org)
