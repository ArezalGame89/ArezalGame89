Name's Arezalgamer89, but I go with too many nicknames.

My hobbies and favorites change over time and programming with GitHub is one of them.

I mostly write Python programs that have absolutely no use in the real world but I use it as an excuse because **I fucking love GitHub**

Some hobbies include:

🎮 pro-gaming

📑 programming

🖥 computer IT

🐧 linux hardcore

🎬 animationing

💾 developing games

📜 writing SRA documents

🛌 procrastinating


Most of the things you see here is usually uploaded to @Special-Rocket-Agents [\(SRA)](https://github.com/Special-Rocket-Agents) so I can test out Organizations.

[I also hold out a site which I write my incoherent thoughts in there](https://arezg.neocities.org)
